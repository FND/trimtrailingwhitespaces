** About
This script will recursively remove all trailing white spaces in all
text files in a given directory. Binary files and files residing in
version control specific directories are skipped.

As an addition one can also let it clean out obsolete or empty/superfluous
Modelica /annotations/ from [[https://modelica.org][Modelica]] (=*.mo=) files.

It uses a binary tester based on the python magic implementation from
	Adam Hupp, http://hupp.org/adam/hg/python-magic

As a fallback (especially if libmagic is not available, like on Windows)
it acts only on files with a given file extension listed in 'extstring'.
